The Open Ruby Foundation is a nonprofit corporation dedicated to the development and proliferation of the Ruby programming language; a growing tribe of teachers and learners that have come together to help welcome the next generation of Rubyists to our community.

If you'd like to get involved we encourage you to come follow along with us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/openrubyfound) and [GitHub](https://github.com/openrubyfoundation).
