The Open Ruby Foundation is a nonprofit corporation dedicated to the development and proliferation of the [Ruby programming language](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/); a growing tribe of teachers and learners that have come together to help welcome the next generation of Rubyists to our community.

Today we launched our first project, the [Ruby Galaxy](https://rubygalaxy.io/) global Ruby meetup. On January 28th we'll be holding our first event and we would love to have you [come share your Ruby knowledge with us](https://github.com/openrubyfoundation/rubygalaxy). You'll be in good company, Matz will be joining us to deliver the first ever Ruby Galaxy keynote.

Hundreds of thousands of developers around the world have already discovered the joy of writing Ruby. It's a beautiful, expressive language designed by Matz to make developers happy, and that focus on the humans behind the code is a large part of what makes this community so special.

For many of us Ruby was our first language and it has had a profound impact on our lives. We've built businesses, careers and lives around the warmth of this gift that so many before us worked to bring to life, so we're coming together now to pay it forward to those following along in our footsteps.

If you've been fortunate enough to benefit from the millions of hours of development that have gone into the Ruby ecosystem we're inviting you to join us. We're just getting started here, there is still plenty to be done.

It is our sincere hope that you'll come along on this journey as we seek to share the joy that Ruby and programming have brought to our lives. For now that starts with a simple follow or a quick hello on GitHub. In the coming months (and years) we're looking forward to bringing you new opportunities to get involved with your Ruby friends.

We're not entirely certain what the future will bring for this foundation or for our community but we're very sure that the ride is going to be a lot more fun together.

For those of you who have been around a while we would like to say thank you, we stand on the shoulders of giants and we are incredibly grateful for everything you've done to bring this language and this community to where we are today.

To the newcomers we extend a heartfelt welcome, you are the future of our language and we can't wait to see all of the beautiful things you will build for the world.
